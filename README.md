Wanchain is a public blockchain working on decentralized cross-chain interoperability. 

The financial ecosystem of tomorrow will be built on many assets relying on heterogeneous chains, protocols and technologies. Wanchain aims to link all these assets, in a decentralized trustless and permissionless manner. 

A decentralized interoperability solution is the required component thatâ€™s necessary to create a new financial system.  The current industry is relying on too many third parties such as centralized exchanges and custodians in order to operate. 

The whole purpose of Blockchain technology was to create a decentralized world where value and data could flow freely without intermediaries, in a fully peer to peer manner.

Wanchain aims to become a hub, where financial applications will host services that provide access to assets such as BTC/ETH/ERC20s, with many more to come :)
